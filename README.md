# COMEM+ Citizen Engagement Ionic Starter Project

This project was created following these [setup instructions](https://github.com/MediaComem/comem-citizen-engagement-ionic-setup).


About this app:

This app allows citizens to report and view gelolocated issues.
Users can create an account, login like on most mobile apps.



They can then consult the map and see each issue reported. Opening the map will geolocate them automatically and show the current area. Clicking on a marker will lead to the issue page.
