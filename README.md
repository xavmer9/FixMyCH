# COMEM+ Citizen Engagement Ionic Starter Project

This project was created following these [setup instructions](https://github.com/MediaComem/comem-citizen-engagement-ionic-setup).


About this app:

This app allows citizens to report and view gelolocated issues.
Users can create an account, login like on most mobile apps.



They can then consult the map and see each issue reported. Opening the map will geolocate them automatically and show the current area. Clicking on a marker will lead to the issue page.

Users can also consult the list of issues, and filter the list. By clicking on an issue, they can get all the details about it.

Users can also view and posts comments on issues.

Each logged in user can simply report an issue (it will geolocate him automatically) with various details (description, image, category...etc)
